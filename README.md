## Installation

Copy the two Swift classes included in the repo in your project.


## Usage

Add a UITextfield and set its class as AMUITiteledTextField. Use **borderStyle** = .none.


The custom textfield could be configured on the Storyboard itself since all the variables are IBInspectable. 

Used with the base class AMUIBaseTextField you can add a regex to check for valid input. Select **Is Validation Mandatory** if you want to make this TextField mandatory (ie.: the user cannot leave it blank...).

You can also select the attribute **Toolbar Enabled** to show a toolbar in order to close the keyboard.
